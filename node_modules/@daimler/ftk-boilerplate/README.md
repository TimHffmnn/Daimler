## Quickstart Guide

From zero to a running WebApp with only a few simple commands:

1. Create a **new** `npm` project

    ```bash
    mkdir my-app
    cd my-app
    npm init -y
    ```

2. Install the FTK boilerplate as your first dependency

    ```bash
    npm install @daimler/ftk-boilerplate
    ```

    > Once the boilerplate installation is finished you will find all necessary project files in your project folder.  
    > Now the 3rd party dependencies can be installed.

3. Install 3rd party dependencies

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Start developing

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

**Happy coding!**
